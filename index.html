          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            I earned my PhD in Rhetoric, Composition, and the Teaching of
            English at the University of Arizona. My research focues using
            interdisciplinary researc skills to developed ethical, community
            engaged research practices. I design and teach courses in Technical
            and Professional Writing, including Writing for the Web, UX Research
            and Testing, Technical Editing, and Web Development.</p>
        
           <p> As an instructor, my classes emphasize accessibility, user
            experience, and collaborative workflows. I often build in
            service-learning projects so students can work with real clients and
            institutional partners.Across all of my courses, I encourage
            students to connect theory with practice and to develop professional
            portfolios that highlight their growth. I strongly believe students
            need exposure to a balance of digital literacy skills, and ethical
            frameworks grounded in critical theory.

        <section id="research"><h1>CV and Academic Research</h1>
<p>As a researcher and teacher, I focus on work that supports meaningful community engagement.
   I strongly believe in open-access, community-engaged scholarship that unites several disciplines
    and bridges academic and community spaces. My research specializes in the rhetoric of 
    collective memory, and it is informed by coursework in film studies and my background in
     digital media. In particular, my research examines how rhetorical practices of public memory
      foster empowerment, resistance, and recognition of marginalized communities. 
      My dissertation, <cite>Into Space Filmbook: Public Memory in New Mexico's Central Mining District</cite>, 
      was awarded an honorable mention at CCCC this year for the <em>James Berlin Outstanding 
      Dissertation Award</em>. The project applies feminist rhetorical methods and a digital humanities 
      approach to an oral history case study investigating how a group of people maintain their 
      sense of community despite a loss of home. As a result of this research, I have published 
      “The Shrine of Chino Mine: Extraction Rhetoric and Public Memory in Southern New Mexico” in 
      <cite>Xchanges</cite>. I am also currently revising my webtext “Shaping Narratives: Exploring A Hybrid 
      Documentary Methodology,” which was accepted to <cite>Kairos: A Journal of Rhetoric, Technology, 
      and Pedagogy</cite>. This article highlights how cultural and digital rhetorics create a fruitful 
      intersection for rhetorical scholarship.

  <section id="teaching"><h1>Teaching Portfolio</h1>
<p>My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that classrooms serve as spaces for 
  fostering community and preparing students for their various careers. In particular, 
  my classes focus on ethical decision-making in both writing and design. I also place an 
  emphasis on students learning to collaborate on teams using the agile workflow, as well as 
  teaching students how to give and receive critical feedback in a variety of contexts. I have 
  recently taught several technical rhetoric courses, including Introduction to Technical and 
  Professional Writing, Technical Editing, Media Theory & Production, UX Research & Design, 
  Writing for the Web, and Web Development. Whenever I can, I structure my classes as 
  service-learning courses so that students gain hands-on experience working with clients. 
  In all of my courses, I teach students to research career opportunities in their fields and 
  prepare portfolios for prospective employers.
